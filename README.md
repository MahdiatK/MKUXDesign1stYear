https://mahdiatk.github.io/MKUXDesign1stYear/


## Introduction


This is a very primitive site that is made primarily of showing a marketplace to buy used BMW vehicles from


### Design Choices -'change as per your needs include old and revised wireframes '


- I will be using a mixture of white colour text against the darker contrasting background colours. (Vice versa for the navbars and footer text)
  - 'you notes goes here '

  - **Structure**
    - No templates used, I wanted to have my own approach to the layout.

  - **Imagery**
    -  I obtained stock free to use images.

  - **Wireframes**
    - I restructured all elements of the original wireframe, to have a cleaner and more modern layout, including potential for dropdowns, fit for mobile screens as well.

You can view the wireframes here:

### Manual Testing

#### With each change minor or major, such as adding containers, adjusting footer sizes, or adding font families, I made sure to open the website locally to check no side effects were present. There were a few instances when trying to adjust the footer in the find-cars.html where the text block in the header wouldn't show as white, that's where I had to add an !important so that it overrid any other colour arguments made by the rest of the page
